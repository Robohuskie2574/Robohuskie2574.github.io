TODO/IDEAS:

Fill in scedule FINISH Before any trips after duluth

Update sponser info page FINISH Before we look for new sponsers

Add a team info page? (like list of members)? (might need to Combine FRC 2023 and scedule). We could also make the scedule part of it LOW PRIORITY

Ways to convince new members to join? (videos, a list of reasons to join?) BEFORE 2024-2025 info meeting.
