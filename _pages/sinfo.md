## Sponsor info and Guidelines
Thanks for being interested in sponsoring us! Sponsors can get benefits such as a place on our website, your company name on out t-shirts, and your logo on our robot. You can [contact us.]({{site.baseurl}}/Contact/) VIA email.

## Picking the best logo to send
The website and logo can use the same logo or different logos.
Your logo for the website:
<ul>
  <li>Should be a high enough resolution to look good when scaled up, like when viewing the website on a large monitor.</li>
  <li>Must not be taller than it is wide.</li>
  <li>Should not be too wide. A logo more than 2.5-3 times it's height is not recommended for it may be too short when on the website.</li>
</ul>
Your logo for the robot should:
<ul>
  <li>Look good at a range of distances.</li>
  <li>Have a reasonably high resolution.</li>
</ul>
If you don't send a logo, we will find one for you.
