## Picking the best logo to send
We recommend the logo you send us should look good in a variety of situations. The logo you send us should check the following boxes:
<ul>
  <li>A high enough resolution to look good when scaled up, like on a large monitor</li>
  <li>Should look good, even from afar</li>
  <li>You may be asked for a 2-color logo, or a logo without gradients</li>
  <li>If your logo goes on the website, it should not be taller than it is wide</li>
</ul>
