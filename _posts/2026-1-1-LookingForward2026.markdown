Now that it is 2026, it is time to think about the next season! RoboHuskie kickoff, and the announcement of this year's game is Saturday January 10th at 11 pm CST. You can view the livestream on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@FIRSTRoboticsCompetition/videos) or twitch and we know that the game is called Rebuilt! This year we are hoping to look at swerve drive, and we are planning to do 2 competitions. While this costs a fair amount of money, we think we can do it! If you are interested in sponsoring us to help with this, please check out the [sponsors info page]({{site.baseurl}}/sinfo/). We are excited for Rebuilt!
